MintDuino Reflex Game

I've worked through the exercises in the instruction booklet for making the MintDuino
Reflex Game. Now, I want to expand beyond and see how much I've learned. I want to make
it a four player game with the buttons easier to get to than they currently are. I also
want to add an LCD screen to keep score.
